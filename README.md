# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of Job Salaries by country


This is a project to explore the salaries of Data Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Machine Learning Engineers over the years, organized by country. In this project, we will examine both the top-ranking and bottom-ranking countries by salary. We will then observe possible relationships and causes.
